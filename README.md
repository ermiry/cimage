# Cimage

**Cimage** is a cross-platform desktop application that helps you manage your photos and videos by organizing them in any way you like. **Cimage** is written in C by implementing **ermiry's Cengine framework (cengine.ermiry.com)**, which works on top of SDL2.

**Cimage's** objective is to provide an easy to use cross-platform application, not only for desktop OS (Linux, Mac OS, Windows), but also for mobile devices (Android and iOS) and even a web application, to manage your photos and videos across your different devices.

Development for **Cimage** started in 04/October/2018 as an only Linux desktop application designed to manage and display photos in a very minimalistic environment and with very little image manipulation in mind. But since then, many other features have been added to create a greater experience. And expect constant updates to get the must out of your photos.

## Current Features

- Open a folder to display its general media content (only images and videos in supported formats)
- Organize and display your media files by name, type, date, location, or by implementing your own structure
- Open an image file in the current or in a dedicated window for display
- Support for image slideshows (with various adjustable settings)
- Video player
- Save and sync your configuration across your multiple devices (requires an ermiry account)

## Upcoming Features

- Support for media hosting in ermiry's servers (requires an ermiry account)
- Image annotation (draw and take notes directly in your photos)
- Handwritten text recognition
- Image classification and recognition (detect common objects in your photos)
- Face recognition
- Pose recognition

### Download

You can download the rolling update version of cimage by clonning this repository; although there is no warranty of a seamless user experience.

Or you can download the last stable release in the release tab here on GitHub or from the official download page: cimage.ermiry.com

### Usage

Open **cimage** and select you photos folder. Then select the parameters you want to organize your photos and let **cimage** do its magic. A small file will be generated and you can use it cross-platform to view your photos in the same way in all your devices (assuming the same folder hierarchy is being used).
